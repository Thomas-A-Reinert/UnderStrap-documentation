The [_s theme](https://underscores.me/){:target="_blank"} is a good starting point to develop a WordPress theme. But it is “just” a raw starter theme. That means it outputs all the WordPress stuff correctly but without any layout or design. Why not add a well known and supported layout framework to have a solid, clean and responsive foundation?

That’s where Bootstrap comes in.

## What is the difference between distributions on WordPress.org and Github?

The [release on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/understrap/){:target="_blank"} is the official stable version that is also available through WordPress built in theme installer.

The [release on Github](https://github.com/understrap/understrap){:target="_blank"} is the current development or “cutting edge” version. You can also download it from there. But you should use it at your own risk. You are also cordially invited to fork it from there, participate in UnderStrap´s development or post any issue you may stumble upon.
