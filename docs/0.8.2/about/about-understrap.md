## Team

UnderStrap is maintained by a [small team of developers](https://github.com/orgs/understrap/people) on GitHub. We're actively looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you're excited about WordPress themes and integrating Bootstrap into WordPress themes at scale, writing Templates and additional Plugins for UnderStrap, and improving build tooling processes for our code.

## History

Originally founded by created by Holger Koenemann [@holger1411](https://github.com/holger1411) a Frontend Dev & UX Designer in 2014 to merge the _s Starter Theme from Automattic with Boostrap v3.

On April 2016 the development switched from integrating Bootstrap 3 to using the Bootstrap 4 Alpha.

About 30 releases later, Bootstrap 4.1 is used, also supporting CSS and settings for WooCommerce and Contact Form 7 while trying to stay as barebone as possible.
